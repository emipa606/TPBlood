[h1]DESCRIPTION[/h1]

Geckobold showed me a mod called [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180573408]Rim of Madness - Bones[/url] and that made me love butchering things even more, and as I was butchering my sixth raider of that day, I thought, "I wanna live, eat, and breathe blood."

You can, with this mod and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180573408]Rim of Madness - Bones[/url], make a house and sustain yourself off of your enemies!... Well you could already with RoM-B, but now it's easier and more sick!

[h1]WHAT DOES IT DO?[/h1]

The main use of the mod is that blood is a food item that is .02 nutrition less than raw meat. It can be used in cooking and building, as of right now. Hint hint.

Once you research "Blood Combinement" for 250 points, you can create bloodstone bricks at a butcher's table. 1 blood equal 1 brick, and there are four recipes. 25 bricks, 50 bricks, 75 bricks, and 100 bricks.

After "Blood Combinement", you can research "Blood Refinement" for 500 points which allows the crafting of bloodcrete at the blood altar, a workbench specialized for the creation of bloodcrete. Bloodcrete is a 1:2 ratio, so to make 25 bricks you need 50 blood, and so on so forth.
